Previous Week:
- Unpacked learnings from Sprint 2
- Started work on our detailed Architecture Diagram
Continued doing more User Research

Next Week:
- Start building an outfit database
- Flesh out the design of our product
- Start prototyping and testing features

Risks/Challenges:
- Finding outfits to train our models can be challenging
Building an accurate recommendation engine; it is easy to fall down a rathole and spend a lot of time trying to make a good recommendation system.
- Linking our recommendations to the eBay site also appears to be a challenge since items change on the site continuously.
# week 7
Previous Week:

- Researched various technologies and created a plan for how to implement these technologies into potential product features

Next Week:
- Unpack learnings from Sprint 2
- Validate the narrative with various current eBay and non-eBay shoppers 

Risks/Challenges:
- There are many potential features we could add to the product, but it will be a challenge to decide which features we can feasibly build and which to prioritize
- There are many potential customer segments we could target, but trying to build a product that meets all their needs might be too much, we need to decide how to narrow our scope
# week 6
Previous Week:
- Met with the company advisor about our new current product direction and narrative.
- Changed and updated our product description, product loop, architecture diagram and Narrative Complete Product.

- Updating the billboard

Risks/Challenges:
- We made a lot of changes in the past week and we need to validate them during sprint 2.
- Developing machine learning algorithm on raw data is feasible, need to find a way to clean data.
- The landscape is competitive; need to focus on finding a novel solution which is benefitted by eBay's unique consumer data.

# week 5
Progress this week:

Risks:
   - None of us is familiar with Django, which may take a lot of time to build an initial website.
