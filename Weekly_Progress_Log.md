# week 5
Progress this week:
- Got more feedback on our initial idea at the Crit meeting
- Trying to pivot the idea to reach a better target audience
- Learning the problems people face with shopping both online and in brick-and-mortar stores

Plan for next week:
- Have a first draft user interface
- Make progress with classification methods for different types of clothes shoppers

Risks:
- Current target audience may not be large enough
- Finding a purpose for customers to use our product as opposed to other means of shopping

# week 4
Previous Week:
  - Find out what kind of framework we should use to build our website.

Next Week:
   - Get start with computer vision technology.
   - Implement our initial website with some basic function
   - Find a way to incorporate eBay's varied and vast data into our solution

Risks:
   - None of us is familiar with Django, which may take a lot of time to build an initial website.
   - Developing machine learning algorithm on raw data is feasible, need to find a way to clean data.

## week 3
Previous Week:
  - Met with studio advisor for input on what direction to take for our challenge

Next Week:
  - Conduct more research into personalized recommendation technologies

  - Virtual meeting with eBay on Thursday to touch-base on our work.

Risks:
  - Need to be diligent on scope creep; a lot of complicated technologies are used in this space and implementation may be infeasible if we try to do too much.
