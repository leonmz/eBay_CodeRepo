##week3
Previous Week:
  - Met with studio advisor for input on what direction to take for our challenge
  - Re-evaluated our approach to the challenge by focusing on general user issues when shopping for clothes.
  - Spent 24 hours to develop our narrative and create a low-fi demo of our initial solution
  - Presented our work in a 3-minute presentation on Friday.

Next Week:
   - Conduct more research into personalized recommendation technologies
   - Find a way to incorporate eBay's varied and vast data into our solution
   - Virtual meeting with eBay on Thursday to touch-base on our work.

Risks:
   - Need to be diligent on scope creep; a lot of complicated technologies are used in this space and implementation may be infeasible if we try to do too much.
   - The landscape is competitive; need to focus on finding a novel solution which is benefitted by eBay's unique consumer data.
