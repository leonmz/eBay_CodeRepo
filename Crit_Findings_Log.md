# Crit Findings Log (Summarize Feedback from Crit):
## 9.26
- Biggest takeaways were that the critters felt we were too focused on producing a product that satisfies eBay’s desires and that is too close to the actual How Might We proposal.
- Too caught up on the word “recommendation”
- They were curious as to why we focused on fashion buyers (specified in HMW), and didn’t decide to focus on a customer that doesn’t really care about fashion, doesn’t like to shop, doesn’t have the time, and doesn’t want to spend the time shopping.
- Surfaced the idea we had discussed initially about a Tindr for outfits to get “fashion” data on users.
- Also surfaced the idea we had discussed about a virtual closet, however added the idea that we could create a virtual closet using what people bought on eBay, which is interesting.
- Commented that similar challenges had been done in the past.
