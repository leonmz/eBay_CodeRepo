### Person 2:
Person 2:
Gender: Female
Age: 51
From: New Jersey
Lives: New Jersey
1. Tell me about your last experience going clothes shopping:
>    She went to the mall to buy athleisure clothing at the store Athleta. She went there because she had a coupon. When she got there a woman helped her pick out clothes. She wasn’t sure if she liked any of the clothes 100%. They also didn’t accept the coupon at checkout, and she ended up buying none of the clothes.
2. What did you enjoy most about it?:
>    She liked that a woman was helping her shop because she was very attentive and seemed to have a good fashion sense. At the same time, she doesn’t enjoy it when people at the store try to help her shop because she ends up spending hours trying on different things at the dressing room, and she doesn’t know how to politely say she would like to leave. She likes the excitement/expectation that she might look awesome in some new clothes, but that usually doesn’t happen because some part of the clothing doesn’t quite look how she expects it to look on her.
3. What part was most annoying?:
>    She hates being in the dressing room for 2 hours. She hates trying on clothes and also doesn’t love shopping. But she does want to look good. Nothing she tries on looks good enough in all the right places, and she also has a tough time making decisions.
4. Tell me about the last time you bought clothes online?:
>    She would look at the models and imagine how the clothing looked on her. After it would ship, she would try it on and find that it looks terrible. It doesn’t look like how it looked on the model. Parts of it don’t lay right. 90% of the time she would return the items she bought online, and she also finds this to be another pain.
5. Why buy clothes online rather than in store?:
>    She got a Venus catalog in the mail and felt like it.
6. How many items did you buy? Did you intend to buy that many?:
>    She bought 6 garments. That’s how many she figured she would buy. She bought some different sizes of the same item because she didn’t know how well they would fit. Sometimes items clothes would come and they would be a different material or feel than expected.
7. Do you consider yourself a fashionable person?:
>    She would say no, but some people at her work complement her fashion. Her daughter would say that she is not fashionable. She thinks that she is fashionable for where she lives (Rural town in New Jersey), but compared to New York City Fashion, she would be considered out of style.
8. Where do you learn about current style trends?:
>    From daughter.
9. Is it ever difficult to keep up with emerging styles?:
>    It’s not difficult because she can ask her daughter. It is also not that important to her to keep up with the style. She also sometimes bases her fashion off of what the mannequins are wearing at Bloomingdales.

##Conclusion of Oct 22 user finding:

People are most frustrated at sizing - not being able to find correct sizes during in-store shopping and not ordering the right size/ fit during online shopping (even though people order more than one size and return sometimes). Some people buy online for special occasions, but many buy in-store. People who shop more frequently tend to buy online for special occasions more than those who don't shop as frequently, perhaps they are more comfortable with the whole process.
